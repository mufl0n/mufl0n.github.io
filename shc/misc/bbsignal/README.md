# TL;DR

We get a `bbsignal.sal` file. Google Search suggests that it can be
opened with Logic 2 analyzer - opening it there shows two channels,
one with a fixed 0 and the other with some binary signal.

For a `baby` challenge, I did not expect complicated things - and
generic serial protocol was actually the very first thing I tried &#128578;
